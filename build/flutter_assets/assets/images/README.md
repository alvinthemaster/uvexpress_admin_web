# Assets - Images

## Logo Setup

To complete the branding update, please add your Godtrasco logo file as:

**`godtrasco_logo.png`**

### Requirements:
- **Format**: PNG (recommended for transparency support)
- **Size**: Recommended 64x64 pixels or higher (square aspect ratio preferred)
- **Background**: Transparent or white background
- **File name**: Exactly `godtrasco_logo.png`

### Supported formats:
- PNG (recommended)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG (if you change the code to use `flutter_svg`)

### Location:
Place your logo file in this directory: `assets/images/`

The code will automatically use your logo in the sidebar and will fallback to a generic business icon if the logo file is not found.
